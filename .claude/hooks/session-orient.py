"""SessionStart hook: inject "where are we" orientation so a session never starts blind.

CLAUDE.md is the only file loaded every session; the live project state
(`.claude/memory/process/phase-state.md`, the latest session note, the roadmap) is NOT. Without
this, orientation depends on the `process`/`memory` skills happening to surface by description
match — probabilistic, which is exactly what the phase-gate design refuses for everything else
("enforced by structure, not discipline"). This hook makes it mechanical: on a fresh start it reads
the state files and hands the main session a compact briefing (current phase, open gate debt, what
the last session left, what's next) plus the standing kickoff questions.

Wired for the `startup|clear` sources only (see settings.json) — a mid-work `resume`/`compact` still
has the context, so re-injecting there would be noise.

No active project → silent. If `phase-state.md` says the project hasn't started (pre-`/intake`),
this emits nothing: quick one-off use of the scaffold stays ceremony-free, per PROCESS.md's
"ad-hoc asks don't gate" rule.

Fail-open on anything unparseable: a briefing hook that bricks startup teaches people to delete it.
